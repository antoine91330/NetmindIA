# Cybersecurity AI App

## Overview

Project Target:

The targets of our project are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These entities have limited financial means and/or internal resources and may not necessarily have the luxury to invest (either in time or money) in an optimal network infrastructure in terms of cybersecurity.

The Problem:

Despite the increasing number of cyber attacks every day, some organizations do not allocate dedicated resources to cybersecurity (technologies, human resources, processes, etc.). This observation is even more significant within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as these organizations have very limited resources, making them highly vulnerable to increasingly frequent cyber attacks (60% of attacked SMEs do not recover and go bankrupt within 18 months following the attack).

This lack of consideration can have significant consequences for organizations (loss of reputation, service unavailability, cost of problem resolution, legal actions, organization closure).

The Solution:

Introduce an AI-based solution that assists Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in maintaining the security level of their organizations.

Value Proposition:

Unlike other solutions on the market, ours focuses on SMEs by constructing an AI capable of correlating potential vulnerabilities with previously occurred attack cases in the same sector (meaning that if another SME has recently experienced a certain type of attack, our AI will prioritize patching for that specific type of attack). It offers a range of automated actions to save time for your CIO in implementing patches for these vulnerabilities. Finally, it aims to be as effective as possible by prioritizing vulnerabilities based on the organization's context to focus primarily on the most dangerous vulnerabilities affecting the operation of your organization.

To assist SMEs, we offer two types of packages. The first is the package where we leave the administration of the tool to the client. This option is suitable for businesses with the resources to manage the solution internally. The second is the package where we handle the administration of the tool, allowing the company's resources to concentrate on patching vulnerabilities. Our team will be responsible for reporting vulnerabilities back to the company.

## Features

- **Patch Management:**
Directly on the homepage, our app displays the most important vulnerabilities to patch and the most exposed machines. Dashboards are also here to help understanding the network security score you have.

- **AI Detection:**
In our application, we leverage AI to prioritize patching for the most prevalent vulnerabilities, based on the latest cyber attacks targeting SMEs. This intelligent system analyzes recent cyber incidents within the SME sector, allowing us to proactively address and patch the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk, enhancing overall cybersecurity effectiveness.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Mention if your app has an easy-to-use interface for users.
Our app is user-friendly thanks to the homepage dashboards, the simplicity to patch vulnerabulities in few clicks and a chatbox that can help you if you are in trouble.
